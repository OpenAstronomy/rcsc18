# Exploring History

As we saw in the previous lesson, we can refer to commits by their identifiers. You can refer to the most recent commit of the working directory by using the identifier HEAD.

We‚Äôve been adding one line at a time to mars.txt, so it‚Äôs easy to track our progress by looking, so let‚Äôs do that using our HEADs. Before we start, let‚Äôs make a change to mars.txt.


{:.input_area}
```xonsh
nano mars.txt
cat mars.txt
```

{:.output_stream}
```



```

Now, let‚Äôs see what we get.


{:.input_area}
```xonsh
git diff HEAD mars.txt
```

{:.output_stream}
```


```

which is the same as what you would get if you leave out HEAD (try it). The real goodness in all this is when you can refer to previous commits. We do that by adding ~1 (where ‚Äú~‚Äù is ‚Äútilde‚Äù, pronounced [til-duh]) to refer to the commit one before HEAD.


{:.input_area}
```xonsh
git diff HEAD~1 mars.txt
```

{:.output_stream}
```


```

If we want to see the differences between older commits we can use git diff again, but with the notation HEAD~1, HEAD~2, and so on, to refer to them:


{:.input_area}
```xonsh
git diff HEAD~2 mars.txt
```

{:.output_stream}
```


```

We could also use git show which shows us what changes we made at an older commit as well as the commit message, rather than the differences between a commit and our working directory that we see by using git diff.
git show HEAD~2 mars.txt

In this way, we can build up a chain of commits. The most recent end of the chain is referred to as HEAD; we can refer to previous commits using the ~ notation, so HEAD~1 means ‚Äúthe previous commit‚Äù, while HEAD~123 goes back 123 commits from where we are now.

We can also refer to commits using those long strings of digits and letters that git log displays. These are unique IDs for the changes, and ‚Äúunique‚Äù really does mean unique: every change to any set of files on any computer has a unique 40-character identifier. Our first commit was given the ID f22b25e3233b4645dabd0d81e651fe074bd8e73b, so let‚Äôs try this:


{:.input_area}
```xonsh
git diff f22b25e3233b4645dabd0d81e651fe074bd8e73b mars.txt
```

{:.output_stream}
```


```

That‚Äôs the right answer, but typing out random 40-character strings is annoying, so Git lets us use just the first few characters:


{:.input_area}
```xonsh
git diff f22b25e mars.txt
```

{:.output_stream}
```


```

All right! So we can save changes to files and see what we‚Äôve changed‚Äînow how can we restore older versions of things? Let‚Äôs suppose we accidentally overwrite our file:


{:.input_area}
```xonsh
nano mars.txt
cat mars.txt
```

{:.output_stream}
```



```

git status now tells us that the file has been changed, but those changes haven‚Äôt been staged:


{:.input_area}
```xonsh
git status
```

{:.output_stream}
```
On branch master
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

	[31mmodified:   02-creating-repositories_instructor.ipynb[m
	[31mmodified:   03-tracking-changes_instructor.ipynb[m
	[31mmodified:   04-exploring-history_instructor.ipynb[m

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")


```

We can put things back the way they were by using git checkout:


{:.input_area}
```xonsh
git checkout HEAD mars.txt
cat mars.txt
```

{:.output_stream}
```



```

As you might guess from its name, git checkout checks out (i.e., restores) an old version of a file. In this case, we‚Äôre telling Git that we want to recover the version of the file recorded in HEAD, which is the last saved commit. If we want to go back even further, we can use a commit identifier instead:


{:.input_area}
```xonsh
git checkout f22b25e mars.txt
```

{:.output_stream}
```


```


{:.input_area}
```xonsh
cat mars.txt
```

{:.output_stream}
```


```


{:.input_area}
```xonsh
git status
```

{:.output_stream}
```
On branch master
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

	[31mmodified:   04-exploring-history_instructor.ipynb[m

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")


```

Notice that the changes are on the staged area. Again, we can put things back the way they were by using git checkout:


{:.input_area}
```xonsh
git checkout HEAD mars.txt
```

{:.output_stream}
```

<p>The ‚Äúdetached HEAD‚Äù is like ‚Äúlook, but don‚Äôt touch‚Äù here, so you shouldn‚Äôt make any changes in this state. After investigating your repo‚Äôs past state, reattach your HEAD with git checkout master.</p>

</div>

</section>


It‚Äôs important to remember that we must use the commit number that identifies the state of the repository before the change we‚Äôre trying to undo. A common mistake is to use the number of the commit in which we made the change we‚Äôre trying to get rid of. In the example below, we want to retrieve the state from before the most recent commit (HEAD~1), which is commit f22b25e:

![](http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/fig/git-checkout.svg)

So, to put it all together, here‚Äôs how Git works in cartoon form:

<h2><span class="fa fa-thumb-tack"></span> # Simplifying the Common Case</h2>
</div>


<div class="panel-body">

<p>If you read the output of git status carefully, you‚Äôll see that it includes this hint:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>(use &quot;git checkout -- &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to discard changes in working directory)
</pre></div>


<p>As it says, git checkout without a version identifier restores files to the state saved in HEAD. The double dash -- is needed to separate the names of the files being recovered from the command itself: without it, Git would try to use the name of the file as the commit identifier.</p>

</div>

</section>


The fact that files can be reverted one by one tends to change the way people organize their work. If everything is in one large document, it‚Äôs hard (but not impossible) to undo changes to the introduction without also undoing changes made later to the conclusion. If the introduction and conclusion are stored in separate files, on the other hand, moving backward and forward in time becomes much easier.

<p>Jennifer is collaborating on her Python script with her colleagues and realizes her last commit to the group repository is wrong and wants to undo it. Jennifer needs to undo correctly so everyone in the group repository gets the correct change. git revert [wrong commit ID] will make a new commit that undoes Jennifer‚Äôs previous wrong commit. Therefore git revert is different than git checkout [commit ID] because checkout is for local changes not committed to the group repository. Below are the right steps and explanations for Jennifer to use git revert, what is the missing command?</p>

<p>Exploring history is an important part of git, often it is a challenge to find the right commit ID, especially if the commit is from several months ago.</p>
<p>Imagine the planets project has more than 50 files. You would like to find a commit with specific text in mars.txt is modified. When you type git log, a very long list appeared, How can you narrow down the search?</p>
<p>Recall that the git diff command allow us to explore one specific file, e.g. git diff mars.txt. We can apply a similar idea here.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>$ git log mars.txt
</pre></div>


<p>Unfortunately some of these commit messages are very ambiguous e.g. update files. How can you search through these files?</p>
<p>Both git diff and git log are very useful and they summarize a different part of the history for you. Is it possible to combine both? Let‚Äôs try the following:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>$ git log --patch mars.txt
</pre></div>


<p>You should get a long list of output, and you should be able to see both commit messages and the difference between each commit.</p>
