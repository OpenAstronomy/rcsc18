## Citation

You may want to include a file called CITATION or CITATION.txt that describes how to reference your project; the one for Software Carpentry states:

```
To reference Software Carpentry in publications, please cite both of the following:

Greg Wilson: "Software Carpentry: Getting Scientists to Write Better
Code by Making Them More Productive".  Computing in Science &
Engineering, Nov-Dec 2006.

Greg Wilson: "Software Carpentry: Lessons Learned". arXiv:1307.5448,
July 2013.

@article{wilson-software-carpentry-2006,
    author =  {Greg Wilson},
    title =   {Software Carpentry: Getting Scientists to Write Better Code by Making Them More Productive},
    journal = {Computing in Science \& Engineering},
    month =   {November--December},
    year =    {2006},
}

@online{wilson-software-carpentry-2013,
  author      = {Greg Wilson},
  title       = {Software Carpentry: Lessons Learned},
  version     = {1},
  date        = {2013-07-20},
  eprinttype  = {arxiv},
  eprint      = {1307.5448}
}
```

More detailed advice, and other ways to make your code citable can be found at the Software Sustainability Institute blog and in:

> Smith AM, Katz DS, Niemeyer KE, FORCE11 Software Citation Working Group. (2016) Software citation principles. PeerJ Computer Science 2:e86 https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj-cs.86

There is also an `@software{...` BibTeX entry type in case no “umbrella” citation like a paper or book exists for the project you want to make citable.

<div style='padding-left: 5px; padding-top: 0; padding-bottom: 0; padding-right: 0; border: 1px solid; border-color: #7ae78e; padding-bottom: 5px;'><h3>Key Points</h3>
<ul>
<li>Add a CITATION file to a repository to explain how you want your work cited.</li>
</ul></div>
