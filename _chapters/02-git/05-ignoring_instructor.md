# Ignoring Things

What if we have files that we do not want Git to track for us, like backup files created by our editor or intermediate files created during data analysis? Let’s create a few dummy files:


{:.input_area}
```xonsh
mkdir results
touch a.dat b.dat c.dat results/a.out results/b.out
```

{:.output_stream}
```



```

and see what Git says:


{:.input_area}
```xonsh
git status
```

{:.output_stream}
```

	[31mresults/[m

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")


```

Putting these files under version control would be a waste of disk space. What’s worse, having them all listed could distract us from changes that actually matter, so let’s tell Git to ignore them.

We do this by creating a file in the root directory of our project called .gitignore:


{:.input_area}
```xonsh
nano .gitignore
cat .gitignore
```

{:.output_stream}
```



```

These patterns tell Git to ignore any file whose name ends in .dat and everything in the results directory. (If any of these files were already being tracked, Git would continue to track them.)

Once we have created this file, the output of git status is much cleaner:


{:.input_area}
```xonsh
git status
```

{:.output_stream}
```

The only thing Git notices now is the newly-created .gitignore file. You might think we wouldn’t want to track it, but everyone we’re sharing our repository with will probably want to ignore the same things that we’re ignoring. Let’s add and commit .gitignore:


{:.input_area}
```xonsh
git add .gitignore
git commit -m "Ignore data files and the results folder."
git status
```

{:.output_stream}
```

```

As a bonus, using .gitignore helps us avoid accidentally adding to the repository files that we don’t want to track:


{:.input_area}
```xonsh
git add a.dat
```

{:.output_stream}
```


```

If we really want to override our ignore settings, we can use git add -f to force Git to add something. For example, git add -f a.dat. We can also always see the status of ignored files if we want:


{:.input_area}
```xonsh
git status --ignored
```

{:.output_stream}
```

<p>As with most programming issues, there are a few ways that you could solve this. If you only want to ignore the contents of results/plots, you can change your .gitignore to ignore only the /plots/ subfolder by adding the following line to your .gitignore:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>results/plots/
</pre></div>


<p>If, instead, you want to ignore everything in /results/, but wanted to track results/data, then you can add results/ to your .gitignore and create an exception for the results/data/ folder. The next challenge will cover this type of solution.</p>
<p>Sometimes the <strong> pattern comes in handy, too, which matches multiple directory levels. E.g. </strong>/results/plots/* would make git ignore the results/plots directory in any root directory.</p>
